Case 2: Create a listing page with Event Categories from Eventbrite API

- Layout page can be found on the GitHub Pages
- API Test File is where I'm working on the retreival and display of the API data
  --> retreival works, display work in progress
- Filter button Test is where I test the filtration of events with filter buttons
  --> Not working yet (adapt JS)
